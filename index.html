             festival, Verve XII. The first fest of the calendar year demands an amazing footfall of students in a college known 
             for its outstanding interests in youth festivals. Sheer fun and enjoyment overshadows the fest's rather flamboyant 
             appeal. In spite of being a non-technical fest, Verve conducts an amazing amounts of events, coupled with workshops, 
             star talks, musical and dance events, and of course, the college's only exclusive prom night. Needless to say, its a
             fest where creative minds unleash their talents and its effect leaves the audience awestruck.
